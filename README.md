# Credit_Risk_Analysis

**Overview and Deliverables**: Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company:

1. Using our knowledge of the imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries, we’ll evaluate three machine learning models by using resampling to determine which is better at predicting credit risk. First, we’ll use the oversampling RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and then we’ll use the undersampling ClusterCentroids algorithm. Using these algorithms, we’ll resample the dataset, view the count of the target classes, train a logistic regression classifier, calculate the balanced accuracy score, generate a confusion matrix, and generate a classification report.

2. Using our knowledge of the imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries,we’ll use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling with the SMOTEENN algorithm to determine if the results from the combinatorial approach are better at predicting credit risk than the resampling algorithms from Deliverable 1. Using the SMOTEENN algorithm, we’ll resample the dataset, view the count of the target classes, train a logistic regression classifier, calculate the balanced accuracy score, generate a confusion matrix, and generate a classification report.

3. Using our knowledge of the imblearn.ensemble library, we’ll train and compare two different ensemble classifiers, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk and evaluate each model. Using both algorithms, we’ll resample the dataset, view the count of the target classes, train the ensemble classifier, calculate the balanced accuracy score, generate a confusion matrix, and generate a classification report.
